The voice-call in's are not public and
transmitted as scrambled values. From their smartphones caretakers are able to give voice-call in's by simply press a button. The display 
has room for a few important voice-call in's so instead of dialing a number, trying to wake someone up on a walkie-talkie and what not, a caretaker simply
presses a button, say the 'Serious Ill Person' button, and the software will keep calling nurses on watch until someone answers the call and then the call
is routed to the caretaker for immediate action.
