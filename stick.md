STICK does a very particular job; keeping a tab on the number of rafts/logs picked up by each team and by each participant, and it goes a little like this:

1. A scout selects a raft/log of any size
2. She passes the STICKgate carrying her raft and once the gate reads her :\|: it flashes a green
3. She continues past the gate out into the camp

Above the rafting extradition area (REA) a camera sits, mounted vertically focusing down-wards. It watches every raft being hauled off by participants.
Optical Recognition Software recognises the size of the raft and adds it to the barer of the :\|:

The personnel assisting at the REA does supervise the extradition only. They assist scouts to pass the STICKgate correctly and secures the REA 
making sure that no rafts are extradited outside the viewfinder of the STICKcamera.

Participants trying to circumvent the system are logged - their :\|: number is registered and their team or as an individual they are fined for not adhering 
to the rules of the REA.
