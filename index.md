Welcome to The SL2017 App Suite
===============================

TL;DR;
------

The 2017 Danish National Scout Jamboree will greet 40,000+ scouts welcome in July 2017, close to SÃ¸nderborg.

This App Suite is focused with providing participants the tools to signing up, making new friends, and navigating the
Jamboree in an number of ways.

### campOS

The App suite has a name: campOS. It underlines the importance of providing the user with a coherent, responsive, agile, and immersive user experience
no matter what platform it is accessed on. The roving user with her smartphone, the volunteer with his tablet, and the employees 
of the Jamboree Organisation with their Mac and PC seated in offices and private homes all over Denmark and abroad.

#### Components

The center piece of the campOS is the __scoutBook__ where every participant has his own profile and is able to share whatever text, audio, photos and video he sees fit.
Once signed up for the Jamboree the participant is able to access her profile and keep updating it until the end of 2017.
This will facilitate sharing experienced and joyful events amongst participants without resorting to other social medias.
The user can opt to share his profile updates with other social media like Facebook, Twitter, Google+

Another key component of the campOS is the __signUp__. Participants will access the signUp and provide it with their personal information prior to receiving a third element of the campOS:

__r:\|:bbon__ is the third part of the backbone in the campOS. It is a traditional festival ribbon/wristband attached to the wrist of participants,
connecting him to the other participants, via the fourth component:

__backBONE__ is the physical network spanning the entire Jamboree, reaching out to every tent and every participant. 


#### scoutBook

Participants can keep a tab on their friends, post new experiences and share photos, videos, and audios. Any badges achieved partaking in activities are
listed on the profile and so are citations, "hugs" and other means of positive acknowledgement.

#### signUp

signUp collects all the necessary information to write an invoice and issue a r:\|:bbon to the participant.


#### r:\|:bbon

With the r:\|:bbon participants can trace their friends and team members. With the r:\|:bbon any participant can immediately see if
team members or newly made friends are close by as the r:\|:bbon will give slow blinks. In case of emergency the r:\|:bbon will 
will blink avidly red paging the participant to contact his team leader. Making new friends is easy - find a *friend-pole* 
and press two or more r:\|:bbon's together. Each participating r:\|:bbon will update the owners profile with new friends.

#### backBONE

#### job QuickMatch

The job QuickMatch (JQM) is a minor component in the campOS. Job consultants use it to match volunteers (jobbers) with vacancies. Using web sockets every logged-in JQM
is constantly in contact with all other JQM's and all share a up-to-the-second view of vacancies. <span style="color: #2ADA25">70% completed</span>

#### ACTivigator

To the Delivery Committees the __ACTivigator__ is a invaluable tool. It knows the interest in every activity, the current number of 
signed up participants and what activities and courses each participant has signed up for. With the ACTivigator 
DC's are able to out-line activities and in increasing details plan and build the activity.
