The :\|: keeps the youngest participants safe! It knows where you bunk whether it's a tent or you're staying in the trailer park. It will guide you there
if you like. It even has an alarm built in! If you get afraid, are taken suddenly ill, if someone finds you unconcious all you/they have to do is press
the alarm button and answer (or have someone answer) the phone number listed under your name! Haven't got a phone? Phone out of juice? No problem! Someone will
reach your location pretty fast! But remember! It is not a toy and if you use it for no good reason, you will feel the wrath of the Jamboree Security Detail!


With the :\|: participants can trace their friends and team members. With the :\|: any participant can immediately see if
team members or newly made friends are close by as the :\|: will give slow blinks. In case of emergency the :\|: will 
blink avidly red paging the participant to contact his team leader. Making new friends is easy - find a *friend-pole* 
and press two or more :\|:'s together. Each participating :\|: will update the owners profile with new friends.
