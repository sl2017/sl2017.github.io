###guestBook

####Purpose

Building an entire city in one night is quite a promise! And one that was kept on the 2012 Jamboree!

To keep that promise the Delivery Teams have to have quite a bit of information about the people that are going to
inhabite this 'city'; like how old they are, what kind of space they require, how much they expect to help out and
stuff like that.

The guestBook is there to pickup all that information, from the "denizens", and make it accessible in usefull ways
to the Delivery Teams responsible for communications, public relation, logistics, lodging, etc.

####Process

You provide your personal information - just enough for the Jamboree staff and security teams to be able to identify you and and vouch for you should that be necessary.
You 'buy' what ever items you find necessary: a space to put your tent, food for your team, fire wood, access tokens to activities, lectures and courses.
The signUp app will build an invoice, mail it to you and if you accept the balance, you have alternative ways of settling it. Once settled the signUp will
compile your Jamboree Welcome Package which you will receive by Parcel Delivery Service. 

You may decide to sign up your entire team. It is a multi step process. First you identify yourself, then your team and you offer an estimate of the total number of participants
in your team. That involves a deposit which you will have to settle in order to be eligible for finalizing the sign up procedure. Finally you get to sign up each team member and 
then you will receive a parcel delivery with a personal Jamboree Welcome Package addressed to every team member.

Once the Jamboree opens, signUp changes its focus. Now signUp is your goto app if you're up for some action, enlightment, education, knowledge, socializing,
or what ever activity is open. With signUp you have the front seat to all activities, and you know what activities are still available, their price,
any requirements on you, how far from your current position and how to get there. Best of all - if you sign up for an activity and start towards it, 
you will have your seat reserved (or at least as long as it normally would take you to cover the distance). 

signUp keeps a tab of your spendings and if you've set a max on the amount you'd want to spend on activities, signUp will always tell you how much you've
spent and how much you've got left to spend.
