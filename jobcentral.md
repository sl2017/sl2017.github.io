The volunteers and participants on duty at the job centres (not the app; the main job centre and all it's job centre satellites) have access to the jobCentral app
as well and they have an extended view detailing vacancies and jobbers all alike. This routine has been 'on' since late 2014 with job centre volunteers 
matching jobs and finding volunteers and jobbers for a great many tasks during the planning of the Jamboree.

Once completed the employer (the person, team or Delivery Team responsible for posting the job in the first place) may rate you on your performance on the job - and completions and ratings go on your profile
for you to display, and brag about if you like :)
