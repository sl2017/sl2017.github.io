They are the physical extension - you could say that they are the last mile
of the backBONE. They make sure that everyone is ok - are kept out of harms way, don't enter into foolish games with edged weapons, jumping from high places,
speeding on bikes, rollerskates, cars and what not. They watch over you at night and will help you if you're lost! They are constantly connected to 
the Security Detail, the nurses on watch at the Infirmary, local police and camp management. They are the eyes and ears for the Jobcenter and they update 
their walk profile as they go, and it is not secret; you can follow every update by subscribing to the Caretakers Journal
