All reports from volunteers are carbon copied to the Caretakers Journal.

The Security Detail and camp management watches the __judge__ list and trials reports at their discretion. Offenders will see every report sticking to their profile
and they are welcomed to questioning the report. If the Security Detail rejects the questioning of the report, the offender may take his issue with the report to
the camp management for review. Dismissed reports are removed from the participants profile and erased from the __judge__ list.
