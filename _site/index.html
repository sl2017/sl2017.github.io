<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR;</h2>

<p>The 2017 Danish National Scout Jamboree will greet 40,000+ scouts welcome in July 2017, close to Sønderborg.</p>

<p>The App Suite is focused with providing participants the tools to signing up, making new friends, managing activities, 
and navigating the Jamboree in an number of ways.</p>

<p>This web-site is all about building the app suite; the tools, the process, the ends.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="campos">campOS</h3>
<p><a name="definition"></a>
The App suite has a name: campOS. It underlines the importance of providing the user with a unified, coherent, responsive, agile, and immersive user experience
no matter the platform it is accessed on. The roving user with her smartphone, the volunteer with his tablet, and the employees 
of the Jamboree Organisation with their Mac and PC seated in offices and private homes all over Denmark and abroad.</p>

<h4 id="components">Components</h4>

<h5 id="scoutbook">scoutBook</h5>
<p>To the participant the center piece of the campOS is the <a href="scoutbook.html">scoutBook</a> where every participant has his own profile and is able to share whatever text, audio, photos and video he sees fit.
Once signed up for the Jamboree the participant is able to access her profile and keep updating it until the end of 2017. </p>

<h5 id="guestbook">guestBook</h5>
<p>Another key component of the campOS is the <a href="guestbook.html">sign up process</a>. Signing up for the Jamboree is where the journey starts for every scout, volunteer, guest, every day visitor.</p>

<p>It’s like the guest book at the front desk in hotels and larger enterprises with tight access control, hence the name - except this guest book is a smart one 
that is not there to pry on you albeit you might experience it that way!</p>

<h5 id="rbbon">r:|:bbon</h5>
<p><strong>r:|:bbon</strong> is the third part of the campOS. <a href="ribbon.html">:|:</a> for short
You receive it as part of your Jamboree Welcome Package along with the other items in the package (see below)!
It is in many ways a traditional festival ribbon/wristband that you strap around your wrist and use as an access token when entering the
Jamboree Camp site, take part in activities, lectures, training courses, enter the Nordic Kitchen Cantina (where all jobbers and volunteers are served 3 meals a day)
connects and make friends with other participants, and much more!</p>

<h5 id="backbone">backBONE</h5>

<p><strong>backBONE</strong> is the physical network spanning the entire Jamboree, reaching out to every tent and every participant. When we say physical we are not entirely
precise! Most parts of the <a href="backbone.html">backBONE</a> is out of sight whether dug down in the dirt, broadcasted in the air or expedited via high-speed fiber optics in several of the
main buildings on the camp site. But some parts are in fact quite tangible. One such part are the caretakers. You will easily spot them in any crowd.
They wear neon colored barets and carry a 10 feet pole with a neon flag attached. </p>

<h5 id="job-quickmatch">job QuickMatch</h5>

<p>The job QuickMatch (<a href="quickmatch.html">jQM</a>) is a minor component in the campOS. Job consultants use it to match volunteers (jobbers) with vacancies. Using web sockets every logged-in JQM
is constantly in contact with all other JQM’s and all share an up-to-the-second view of vacancies. <span style="color: #2ADA25">70% completed</span></p>

<h5 id="jobcentral">jobCentral</h5>

<p>To the jobber be it full time or jobbers helping out with a one-off 30 minute job, <a href="jobcentral.html">jobCentral</a> is where the action is! jobCentral offers the jobber a perfect
view of all vacant jobs. If a jobber sees at job he likes, all it takes is a push of a button and he is off to do it. Some jobs require you to offer 
certain kind of information and other jobs will ask further requirements on you - like having a drivers license, speaking a language fluently, being a certified doctor etc.
It’s all in the job descriptions.</p>

<h5 id="caretakers-journal">Caretakers Journal</h5>

<p>A micropost blog updated 24 hours around the clock by the caretakers team. There are two parts to <a href="caretaker.html">it</a>. There is the ‘twitter-like’ micropost feed which 
everyone can subscribe to and then there is the voice-call in’s that the caretakers use to signal any situation. </p>

<h5 id="activigator">ACTivigator</h5>

<p><small>[that green river monster will eat your ‘activity elephant’ one bite at a time]</small></p>

<p>To the Delivery Teams (DT) the <a href="activigator.html"><strong>ACTivigator</strong></a> is a invaluable tool. It knows the interest in every activity, the current number of 
signed up participants and what activities and courses each participant has signed up for. </p>

<h5 id="stick">STICK</h5>

<p>An unusual app is what <strong>STICK</strong> is all about; an unusual app for an unusual task! </p>

<p>There are two very exact moments on the entire Jamboree where <a href="stick.html">this app</a> ‘goes live’. For approx 24 hours from when the Jamboree opens and the second time is
just about when the Jamboree closes down, again for approx 24 hours.</p>

<h5 id="judge">Judge</h5>

<p>Jobbers and volunteers on a job that has the potential to causing disagreements over the rules by which the Jamboree operates will have access to
the <a href="judge.html"> <strong>judge</strong></a>. This app offers a few buttons to press in the event of a disagreement. Once pressing a button the jobber/volunteer will read a :|: and
then a report is filed with a timestamp, the jobber id and location. He is able to add photos to the report if pertinent.</p>

<h4 id="jamboree-welcome-package">Jamboree Welcome Package</h4>

<p>Once you have finished the sign up procedure you may sit down and wait impatiently! The Participant Delivery Team will be working around the clock to
have your JWP (Jamboree Welcome Package) out the door the same minute you press the ‘go’ button on that last sign up page!</p>

<p>The JWP will be delivered to you by parcel service for us to make sure that every participant will have his :|:, her scoutBook access information,
his Jamboree Information Leaflet, and a few other small surprises!</p>

<p>One such surprise is the muffler! Go ahead, guess all you like - you’ll never guess what it is, and neither will you figure out what you need it for!
But we will take your bet - it is going to be one epic moment; so look out for the muffler (you cannot miss it once you open the Jamboree Welcome Package)</p>
