<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR;</h2>

<p>The 2017 Danish National Scout Jamboree will greet 40,000+ scouts welcome in July 2017, close to Sønderborg.</p>

<p>This App Suite is focused with providing participants the tools to signing up, making new friends, and navigating the
Jamboree in an number of ways.</p>

<h3 id="campos">campOS</h3>

<p>The App suite has a name: campOS. It underlines the importance of providing the user with a unified, coherent, responsive, agile, and immersive user experience
no matter the platform it is accessed on. The roving user with her smartphone, the volunteer with his tablet, and the employees 
of the Jamboree Organisation with their Mac and PC seated in offices and private homes all over Denmark and abroad.</p>

<h4 id="components">Components</h4>

<h5 id="scoutbook">scoutBook</h5>
<p>To the participant the center piece of the campOS is the <strong>scoutBook</strong> where every participant has his own profile and is able to share whatever text, audio, photos and video he sees fit.
Once signed up for the Jamboree the participant is able to access her profile and keep updating it until the end of 2017. </p>

<p>Whether it will live on 
depends on the success and number of users updating their profiles on a regular basis. If everyone goes back to ‘using’ - then scoutBook has no place and will 
get shut down. If on the other hand scouts all over will keep updating their profiles and use the scoutBook to build a digital presence and allow friends and
scouts all over the world to enjoy and participate - well then it stays!</p>

<p>The scoutBook will facilitate sharing experiences and joyful events amongst participants without resorting to other social medias. No commercials,
no hit counts, no ad-sense! The singular user can opt to share his profile updates with other social media like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ but that is the privilige of the user!</p>

<p>Any badges achieved partaking in activities are listed on the profile as are citations, “hugs” and other means of positive acknowledgement.</p>

<p>Every participants profile will also receive updates from other sources. If you subscribe to the Caretakers Journal (see belov), it will 
list here. When you sign up for an activity an information package will sit in your profile page, for you to read, get anticipated, and understand
what is expected of you, in terms of where to be, when and bringing what with you. If you’re a jobber and has accepted a scheduled job a small 
information package will show up too - again directing you to the place to be, when to be there and what possibly to bring along.</p>

<p>You can subsribe to the camp newsfeed, listen to the camp radio and watch camp screencasts from top 5 popular streaming channels: My Rotten Tomatoes, 
Life of A Jobber, Cantina Fails, Epic Moments and Happy, all from within your profile page.</p>

<p>Your team (and friends) can subscribe to your where-abouts should you choose to enable this. When enabled your :|: will check you in on a number of
locations, from the camp center to activities, to the cantina, to Tranquility (the jobber Refuge), to the Trailers Heaven (the trailer park where parents and friends camp).</p>

<h5 id="signup">signUp</h5>
<p>Another key component of the campOS is the <strong>signUp</strong>. The signUp is where the journey starts for every scout, volunteer, guest, every day visitor.</p>

<p>You provide your personal information - just enough for the Jamboree staff and security teams to be able to identify you and and vouch for you should that be necessary.
You ‘buy’ what ever items you find necessary: a space to put your tent, food for your team, fire wood, access tokens to activities, lectures and courses.
The signUp app will build an invoice, mail it to you and if you accept the balance, you have alternative ways of settling it. Once settled the signUp will
compile your Jamboree Welcome Package which you will receive by Parcel Delivery Service. </p>

<p>You may decide to sign up your entire team. It is a multi step process. First you identify yourself, then your team and you offer an estimate of the total number of participants
in your team. That involves a deposit which you will have to settle in order to be eligible for finalizing the sign up procedure. Finally you get to sign up each team member and 
then you will receive a parcel delivery with a personal Jamboree Welcome Package addressed to every team member.</p>

<p>Once the Jamboree opens, signUp changes its focus. Now signUp is your goto app if you’re up for some action, enlightment, education, knowledge, socializing,
or what ever activity is open. With signUp you have the front seat to all activities, and you know what activities are still available, their price,
any requirements on you, how far from your current position and how to get there. Best of all - if you sign up for an activity and start towards it, 
you will have your seat reserved (or at least as long as it normally would take you to cover the distance). </p>

<p>signUp keeps a tab of your spendings and if you’ve set a max on the amount you’d want to spend on activities, signUp will always tell you how much you’ve
spent and how much you’ve got left to spend.</p>

<h5 id="rbbon">r:|:bbon</h5>
<p><strong>r:|:bbon</strong> is the third part of the campOS. :|: for short
You receive it as part of your Jamboree Welcome Package along with the other items in the package (see below)!
It is in many ways a traditional festival ribbon/wristband that you strap around your wrist and use as an access token when entering the
Jamboree Camp site, take part in activities, lectures, training courses, enter the Nordic Kitchen Cantina (where all jobbers and volunteers are served 3 meals a day)
connects and make friends with other participants, and much more!</p>

<p>The :|: keeps the youngest participants safe! It knows where you bunk whether it’s a tent or you’re staying in the trailer park. It will guide you there
if you like. It even has an alarm built in! If you get afraid, are taken suddenly ill, if someone finds you unconcious all you/they have to do is press
the alarm button and answer (or have someone answer) the phone number listed under your name! Haven’t got a phone? Phone out of juice? No problem! Someone will
reach your location pretty fast! But remember! It is not a toy and if you use it for no good reason, you will feel the wrath of the Jamboree Security Detail!</p>

<p>With the :|: participants can trace their friends and team members. With the :|: any participant can immediately see if
team members or newly made friends are close by as the :|: will give slow blinks. In case of emergency the :|: will 
blink avidly red paging the participant to contact his team leader. Making new friends is easy - find a <em>friend-pole</em> 
and press two or more :|:’s together. Each participating :|: will update the owners profile with new friends.</p>

<h5 id="backbone">backBONE</h5>

<p><strong>backBONE</strong> is the physical network spanning the entire Jamboree, reaching out to every tent and every participant. When we say physical we are not entirely
precise! Most parts of the backBONE is out of sight whether dug down in the dirt, broadcasted in the air or expedited via high-speed fiber optics in several of the
main buildings on the camp site. But some parts are in fact quite tangible. One such part are the caretakers. You will easily spot them in any crowd.
They wear neon colored barets and carry a 10 feet pole with a neon flag attached. </p>

<p>They are the physical extension - you could say that they are the last mile
of the backBONE. They make sure that everyone is ok - are kept out of harms way, don’t enter into foolish games with edged weapons, jumping from high places,
speeding on bikes, rollerskates, cars and what not. They watch over you at night and will help you if you’re lost! They are constantly connected to 
the Security Detail, the nurses on watch at the Infirmary, local police and camp management. They are the eyes and ears for the Jobcenter and they update 
their walk profile as they go, and it is not secret; you can follow every update by subscribing to the Caretakers Journal</p>

<h5 id="job-quickmatch">job QuickMatch</h5>

<p>The job QuickMatch (JQM) is a minor component in the campOS. Job consultants use it to match volunteers (jobbers) with vacancies. Using web sockets every logged-in JQM
is constantly in contact with all other JQM’s and all share an up-to-the-second view of vacancies. <span style="color: #2ADA25">70% completed</span></p>

<h5 id="jobcentral">jobCentral</h5>

<p>To the jobber be it full time or jobbers helping out with a one-off 30 minute job, jobCentral is where the action is! jobCentral offers the jobber a perfect
view of all vacant jobs. If a jobber sees at job he likes, all it takes is a push of a button and he is off to do it. Some jobs require you to offer 
certain kind of information and other jobs will ask further requirements on you - like having a drivers license, speaking a language fluently, being a certified doctor etc.
It’s all in the job descriptions.</p>

<p>The volunteers and participants on duty at the job centres (not the app; the main job centre and all it’s job centre satellites) have access to the jobCentral app
as well and they have an extended view detailing vacancies and jobbers all alike. This routine has been ‘on’ since late 2014 with job centre volunteers 
matching jobs and finding volunteers and jobbers for a great many tasks during the planning of the Jamboree.</p>

<p>Once completed the employer (the person, team or Delivery Team responsible for posting the job in the first place) may rate you on your performance on the job - and completions and ratings go on your profile
for you to display, and brag about if you like :)</p>

<h5 id="caretakers-journal">Caretakers Journal</h5>

<p>A micropost blog updated 24 hours around the clock by the caretakers team. There are two parts to it. There is the ‘twitter-like’ micropost feed which 
everyone can subscribe to and then there is the voice-call in’s that the caretakers use to signal any situation. The voice-call in’s are not public and
transmitted as scrambled values. From their smartphones caretakers are able to give voice-call in’s by simply press a button. The display 
has room for a few important voice-call in’s so instead of dialing a number, trying to wake someone up on a walkie-talkie and what not, a caretaker simply
presses a button, say the ‘Serious Ill Person’ button, and the software will keep calling nurses on watch until someone answers the call and then the call
is routed to the caretaker for immediate action.</p>

<h5 id="activigator">ACTivigator</h5>

<p><small>[that green river monster will eat your ‘activity elephant’ one bite at a time]</small></p>

<p>To the Delivery Teams (DT) the <strong>ACTivigator</strong> is a invaluable tool. It knows the interest in every activity, the current number of 
signed up participants and what activities and courses each participant has signed up for. </p>

<p>With the ACTivigator DT’s are able to out-line activities and in increasing details plan and build the activity. They start out with</p>

<h5 id="stick">STICK</h5>

<p>An unusual app is what <strong>STICK</strong> is all about; an unusual app for an unusual task! </p>

<p>There are two very exact moments on the entire Jamboree where this app ‘goes live’. For approx 24 hours from when the Jamboree opens and the second time is
just about when the Jamboree closes down, again for approx 24 hours.</p>

<p>STICK does a very particular job; keeping a tab on the number of rafts/logs picked up by each team and by each participant, and it goes a little like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A scout selects a raft/log of any size</li>
  <li>She passes the STICKgate carrying her raft and once the gate reads her :|: it flashes a green</li>
  <li>She continues past the gate out into the camp</li>
</ol>

<p>Above the rafting extradition area (REA) a camera sits, mounted vertically focusing down-wards. It watches every raft being hauled off by participants.
Optical Recognition Software recognises the size of the raft and adds it to the barer of the :|:</p>

<p>The personnel assisting at the REA does supervise the extradition only. They assist scouts to pass the STICKgate correctly and secures the REA 
making sure that no rafts are extradited outside the viewfinder of the STICKcamera.</p>

<p>Participants trying to circumvent the system are logged - their :|: number is registered and their team or as an individual they are fined for not adhering 
to the rules of the REA.</p>

<h5 id="judge">Judge</h5>

<p>Jobbers and volunteers on a job that has the potential to causing disagreements over the rules by which the Jamboree operates will have access to
the <strong>judge</strong>. This app offers a few buttons to press in the event of a disagreement. Once pressing a button the jobber/volunteer will read a :|: and
then a report is filed with a timestamp, the jobber id and location. He is able to add photos to the report if pertinent.</p>

<p>All reports from volunteers are carbon copied to the Caretakers Journal.</p>

<p>The Security Detail and camp management watches the <strong>judge</strong> list and trials reports at their discretion. Offenders will see every report sticking to their profile
and they are welcomed to questioning the report. If the Security Detail rejects the questioning of the report, the offender may take his issue with the report to
the camp management for review. Dismissed reports are removed from the participants profile and erased from the <strong>judge</strong> list.</p>

<h4 id="jamboree-welcome-package">Jamboree Welcome Package</h4>

<p>Once you have finished the sign up procedure you may sit down and wait impatiently! The Participant Delivery Team will be working around the clock to
have your JWP (Jamboree Welcome Package) out the door the same minute you press the ‘go’ button on that last sign up page!</p>

<p>The JWP will be delivered to you by parcel service for us to make sure that every participant will have his :|:, her scoutBook access information,
his Jamboree Information Leaflet, and a few other small surprises!</p>

<p>One such surprise is the muffler! Go ahead, guess all you like - you’ll never guess what it is, and neither will you figure out what you need it for!
But we will take your bet - it is going to be one epic moment; so look out for the muffler (you cannot miss it once you open the Jamboree Welcome Package)</p>
