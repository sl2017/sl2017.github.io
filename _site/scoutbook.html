				<p>Whether it will live on 
depends on the success and number of users updating their profiles on a regular basis. If everyone goes back to ‘using’ - then scoutBook has no place and will 
get shut down. If on the other hand scouts all over will keep updating their profiles and use the scoutBook to build a digital presence and allow friends and
scouts all over the world to enjoy and participate - well then it stays!</p>

<p>The scoutBook will facilitate sharing experiences and joyful events amongst participants without resorting to other social medias. No commercials,
no hit counts, no ad-sense! The singular user can opt to share his profile updates with other social media like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ but that is the privilige of the user!</p>

<p>Any badges achieved partaking in activities are listed on the profile as are citations, “hugs” and other means of positive acknowledgement.</p>

<p>Every participants profile will also receive updates from other sources. If you subscribe to the Caretakers Journal (see belov), it will 
list here. When you sign up for an activity an information package will sit in your profile page, for you to read, get anticipated, and understand
what is expected of you, in terms of where to be, when and bringing what with you. If you’re a jobber and has accepted a scheduled job a small 
information package will show up too - again directing you to the place to be, when to be there and what possibly to bring along.</p>

<p>You can subsribe to the camp newsfeed, listen to the camp radio and watch camp screencasts from top 5 popular streaming channels: My Rotten Tomatoes, 
Life of A Jobber, Cantina Fails, Epic Moments and Happy, all from within your profile page.</p>

<p>Your team (and friends) can subscribe to your where-abouts should you choose to enable this. When enabled your :|: will check you in on a number of
locations, from the camp center to activities, to the cantina, to Tranquility (the jobber Refuge), to the Trailers Heaven (the trailer park where parents and friends camp).</p>
